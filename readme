# 🏁 RPA Challenge Bot (UiPath Project)

A high-performance UiPath automation bot built to solve the **RPA Challenge**—a benchmark task for testing speed and accuracy in data entry. This bot demonstrates advanced RPA capabilities including dynamic form handling, file downloads, email automation, and cloud integration.

## 📌 Project Overview

The bot automates the full cycle of the RPA Challenge by downloading the input data directly from the challenge website, processing it through dynamic form fields, and submitting each record with precision. After completing the challenge, it captures a screenshot of the result, uploads it to Google Drive, and sends an HTML-formatted email containing the screenshot link.
